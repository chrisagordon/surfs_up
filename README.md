- December Data shows a maximum of 83 F and minimum of 56 F, the mean is 71 F.

## 3. SUMMARY

- Results show that there is very little deviation in temperature at this location year round which makes it a perfect location to open a Surf and Ice Cream Shop
- Additional queries
  1) It would useful to look into the differences in years during June and Decemeber to see if there are any outlier years this cannot be seen with the current analysis method
  2) How long do the lowest temperature days last? This would need to be taken into consideration for ice cream consumption since cold temperatures would make it less likely for customers to visit
